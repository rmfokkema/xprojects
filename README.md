Shell tricks and Apple scripts, slightly mixed up.

### Show image info
Checks the files you've selected on your Mac (in Finder), and shows dimensions and dpi all selected images. If no useful selection, it will prompt you to select files.
- .scptd: official AppleScript
- .sh: same stuff, but conveniently from the command line

### azialt.sh
Azimuth and altitude are key things in creating [dynamic wallpapers for macOS](https://itnext.io/macos-mojave-wallpaper-iii-c747c30935c4).
This script outputs data from suncalc.org in JSON format, so it can be used with [wallpapper](https://github.com/mczachurski/wallpapper/).
